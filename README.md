# Practice Project - Reviving Coding Skills

## Introduction

This project is part of my journey to get back into coding after completing the BrainStation Software Engineering Bootcamp in August 2024. Since it's been a little while since I last coded, my goal is to refresh and improve my skills through hands-on practice with various technologies and programming concepts.

In this project, I'll be focusing on:

- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend Development**: Node.js, Express
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from APIs and manipulating responses
- **Full-Stack Concepts**: Building out complete features from front to back

## Goals and Skills to Demonstrate

By the end of this project, I plan to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

- **React Components & State Management**: Practice building reusable components, manage state with hooks, and passing props.
- **API Interaction**: Build functionality that retrieves data from public APIs and displays it dynamically.
- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts such as arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
- **Version Control with Git**: Practice proper version control using Git and GitHub to manage code.
- **Problem Solving**: Revisit algorithmic thinking by solving small coding challenges to build my problem-solving skills.

## Motivation

I am excited to sharpen my coding skills again and build something tangible while revisiting key concepts. The ultimate goal of this project is to re-establish confidence in my ability to write code and solve problems effectively.
